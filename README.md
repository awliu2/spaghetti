my leetcode solutions
ig u can copy if you want but idk if they're worth copying TBH :P

I'll go back and redo them all in C eventually.


## Usage <sup><sub>\s</sub></sup>
Visit `leetcode.com/problemset/all` and select the desired problem.

### MacOS
1. Select the desired file in the repository, in the desired langauge. *Note: files under the* `python` *subdir are written in python3.*
2. Use `CMD - A + CMD - C` to select and copy the contents of the file
3. navigate back to your browser, select the interactive editor, and use `CMD - V` to paste.
4. Bask in the glory of optimal runtime.

|question|issue|
|---|---|
|`searchInRotatedSorted`|can find the "pivot" but having difficulty with the second binary search and edge cases|
|`timeMap`|haven't looked at it in a while|
|`encodeDecode`| edge case of `[]` doesn't work|
|`groupAnagrams`|returns 



- **search in rotated sorted array**
    - can find the "pivot" but having difficulty with the second binary search and edge cases
- **timeMap**
    - haven't looked at this one in a while
- **encode decode**
    - edge case of empty string doesn't work
- **group anagrams**
    - gave up trying to fix duplicate outputs, current solution is not 100% mine
- **product of array except self**
    - haven't looked at this one in a while
- **min stack**
    - did this one with Rohan, need to do again
- **number of islands**
    - try to figure it out again myself
